TODO:

- Need a vignette.  It should include a fair bit of information on
  running doMPI scripts using orterun, for example.

- Need to benchmark doMPI against doSNOW.  I'd like to know if
  broadcasting really helps.

- Need more examples.

- Need a test suite.


General issues:

- Should we provide a backend-independent function for the worker
  to determine information about themselves, such as its rank, node name
  and verbosity level?  What about the number of other workers started
  on this node?

- Snow supports many more options in starting the workers.
  doMPI assumes an homogeneous installation and uses mpi.
  What other options and mechanisms are important?


Rmpi related issues:

- Should mpi.get.processor.name be used rather than Sys.info()[['nodename']] to
  determine a node id?

- Is mpi.universe.size actually useful for determining the default value of
  "count" in startMPIcluster?  Is it correct to subtract one from it?

- Can mpi.setup.rngstream and mpi.setup.sprng be used to support
  distributed random number generation?
